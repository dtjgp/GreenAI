# the code is to create a class of StorageBattery
# the class is to simulate the behavior of a storage battery in a solar power system
# the class has the following attributes:
# 1. the capacity of the battery
# 2. the energy consumption of the battery
# 3. the energy efficiency of the battery
# 4. the location of the battery
# 5. the power output of the battery
# 6. the power input of the battery
# 7. the state of charge of the battery
# 8. the energy stored in the battery
